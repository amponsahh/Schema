# Schema
Schema is a rudimentary task management web app that was designed and built as a collaborative project between a fellow classmate and I in the spring of 2019 for a Mobile and Web Development Class. 
<br /> It employs techniques such as web storage, canvas & timers and is organized under the Model-View-Control code organization structure. Essentially, Schema operates and functions like a scaled down version of [Todoist](https://todoist.com), a project management application for personal and professional productivity.

<br /> Schema keeps track of a userâ€™s list of items to complete and its accompanying properties like custom priorities and projects. This allows for easy information dissemination at a glance which in turn, allows the user to understand what needs to be completed the earliest and quickest. It also provides a medium for the user to compile related tasks under one custom ID for easy identification and tracking. Lastly, there is a timer function that alerts the user when a desired task is due based on a given set period.
